Provide project status briefing for new session:
1. Read current CLAUDE.md for project state
2. Check recent git commits for latest changes
3. Review any updated documentation in docs/
4. Summarize what was accomplished recently
5. Identify the next logical development tasks
6. Flag any blockers or issues that need attention
7. Verify if last brach is complete, if so,we should start by creating a new git branch and working in that after pulling master and then branching from master.
Give a comprehensive status update to continue development seamlessly.

remember to git add, commit and push when the task is complete.
