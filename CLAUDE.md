## Active Issues & Solutions

### **âœ… RSS Feed Failures - RESOLVED**
- **Previous Issue**: The majority of the configured RSS feeds were failing, preventing the news feed from populating.
- **Root Cause**: DNS lookup failures, 403/404 errors, and malformed XML from various news sources.
- **Solution Implemented**:
  - âœ… **Updated RSS Feed URLs**: Replaced broken feeds with verified working sources
  - âœ… **Enhanced Error Handling**: Added timeout protection, retry logic, and failure tracking
  - âœ… **Improved XML Parsing**: Better handling of malformed XML with cleanup utilities
  - âœ… **Rate Limiting & Caching**: Prevents server overload and improves performance
  - âœ… **Comprehensive Testing**: Added test script to verify all feeds and monitor performance
- **Working Feeds**: Yahoo Finance (2), MarketWatch, CNBC, Seeking Alpha, Fortune, Motley Fool, Benzinga, Federal Reserve, CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, OilPrice.com, TechCrunch Fintech

### âœ… **Dependency Conflicts - RESOLVED**
- **Issue**: `pnpm install` was failing due to a peer dependency conflict between TypeScript `5.9.2` and `@typescript-eslint` packages.
- **Solution**: Implemented `pnpm.overrides` in `package.json` to force the use of a newer, compatible version of the ESLint packages (`^8.39.0`).

### âœ… **TypeScript Errors - RESOLVED**
- **Issue**: TypeScript null safety errors in the news API route.
- **Solution**: Fixed null assertion issues and removed unused variables for clean compilation.

### ðŸŸ¡ **Development Server Instability**
- **Issue**: The Next.js development server frequently fails to start with an `EPERM` error related to file permissions in the `.next` directory.
- **Workaround**: Deleting the `.next` directory sometimes resolves the issue, but a more permanent solution is needed.

## Recent Architectural Decisions

1. **RSS-Based News Aggregation**: Chose a server-side RSS aggregation strategy for the news feed to avoid client-side CORS issues and to allow for centralized caching and processing.
2. **Intelligent Parsing Logic**: Implemented custom logic for ticker extraction, rule-based sentiment analysis, and category classification to enrich the raw RSS data without relying on paid AI services.
3. **Robust Feed Fetching**: Enhanced the news parser with improved fetching mechanisms, including retries with exponential backoff, batch processing, and handling for malformed XML.
4. **PNPM Overrides for Dependency Management**: Used `pnpm.overrides` to resolve a complex peer dependency conflict. This is a key decision for maintaining project stability.
5. **Feed Quality Assurance**: Implemented comprehensive testing and monitoring to ensure RSS feed reliability and performance.

## Testing Status
- **Build**: âœ… Clean TypeScript compilation with all errors resolved
- **Deployment**: âœ… Ready for deployment with working news feed
- **Dark Mode**: âœ… Theme toggle works, all components properly themed
- **API Routes**: âœ… Quote, History, and News endpoints all working perfectly
- **Components**: âœ… All 15+ UI components support both themes
- **RSS Feeds**: âœ… 8+ reliable feeds tested and working with comprehensive error handling
